# 🎯 ARIA: Accessible Rich Internet Applications

## 🔍 Purpose
ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes that help make web applications and dynamic content more accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice recognition software.

---

## 🚫 The First Rule of ARIA
**"Don't use ARIA if you can use native HTML elements instead."**

HTML elements like `<button>`, `<input>`, `<nav>`, etc., come with built-in accessibility features that screen readers and other assistive technologies recognize automatically. Overusing ARIA or using it incorrectly can reduce accessibility.

```html
<!-- ✅ Native HTML: Automatically accessible -->
<button class="auth-button">Login</button>

<!-- ❌ Non-semantic element used as button -->
<div class="auth-button">Signup</div>
```

### ❗Why Native Elements Matter
When using a `<div>` or `<span>` instead of a semantic element like `<button>`, you lose:
- Accessibility features
- Screen reader interaction
- Keyboard focus and events
- Roles and states

---

## 🧩 Reintroducing Functionality with ARIA
If you **must** use a non-semantic element, use ARIA attributes to bring back missing accessibility features.

```html
<!-- 🚫 Not recommended but accessible with ARIA -->
<div class="auth-button" role="button" tabindex="0">Signup</div>
```

### 🔑 Explanation:
- `role="button"`: Tells assistive tech this is a button
- `tabindex="0"`: Makes it focusable via keyboard (Tab key)

⚠️ Still lacks native behavior like `Enter`/`Space` activation, focus outline, etc., unless manually implemented with JavaScript.

## 🔄 Example: Creating an ARIA Switch
ARIA helps when building a UI component that doesn't exist in native HTML, like a toggle switch:

```html
<!-- ✅ ARIA switch example -->
<div
  id="toggleTheme"
  onClick="toggleTheme()"
  class="auth-button"
  role="switch"
  tabindex="0"
  aria-checked="false"
>
  Dark Mode
</div>
```

### 🧠 Explanation:
- `role="switch"`: Identifies the element as a toggle switch
- `aria-checked="false"`: Indicates current state (on/off)
- `tabindex="0"`: Keyboard focusable

You must also:
- Update `aria-checked` via JavaScript when toggled
- Handle `keydown` for `Enter` and `Space` key accessibility

---

## ✅ When to Use ARIA
Use ARIA **only when necessary**, for example:
- You’re creating a **custom component** that doesn’t exist in HTML (e.g. tab panels, sliders, tree views)
- You need to provide **extra context** (e.g. `aria-live`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-describedby`)

## 🚫 When to Avoid ARIA
Avoid ARIA if:
- A native HTML element can do the job
- You’re only using ARIA for styling purposes
- You’re unsure about its effect on accessibility (test it!)

## 🧪 Testing ARIA Usage
| Task                            | Tool                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Test screen reader interaction | NVDA, VoiceOver, or JAWS          |
| Inspect ARIA roles/states      | Chrome DevTools → Accessibility tab |
| Lint for misuse                | ESLint-plugin-jsx-a11y, Axe, WAVE |

## ✅ Final Checklist
- [x] Prefer native HTML elements
- [x] Use ARIA only when needed
- [x] Include `tabindex="0"` for focusable non-semantic elements
- [x] Update dynamic ARIA attributes via JS
- [x] Test keyboard and screen reader interaction
